# hotel-booking site

## Introduction

 This is an online booking site that I created using the knowledge and skills acquired from my MySQL and PHP module. This site has a login system that saves data to the database and verifies the user's input. There is a signup system for first time users. Once the user is logged in they may proceed with the online booking. User enters his/her details along with the required information to make booking true. A summary of the data input is then displayed after the user makes booking along with the cost. Once all is complete the user may logout and the session is destroyed.
